# X-FEEDBACK COMPASS

## Mission

`3neti/x-feedback` is the notification and communication infrastructure package for the x-change Settlement Operating System.

It answers:

```text
Who should be informed, how, and with what delivery result?
```

It does not decide workflow meaning, execute actions, or own lifecycle truth.

## Current Phase

Wave 3 — x-feedback  
Phase 2 — Feedback Event Mapping Baseline  
Status: Complete  
Last updated: 2026-06-30

## Completed Work

- Created independent package scaffold at `/Users/rli/PhpstormProjects/packages/x-feedback`.
- Established package identity:
  - Composer package: `3neti/x-feedback`
  - Namespace: `LBHurtado\XFeedback`
- Added Laravel package auto-discovery for `LBHurtado\XFeedback\XFeedbackServiceProvider`.
- Added `spatie/laravel-data` as the DTO foundation.
- Added package config at `config/x-feedback.php`.
- Added DTOs:
  - `FeedbackIntentData`
  - `FeedbackRecipientData`
  - `FeedbackChannelData`
  - `FeedbackMessageData`
  - `FeedbackContextData`
  - `FeedbackDeliveryData`
- Added contracts:
  - `FeedbackChannelDriverContract`
  - `FeedbackChannelRegistryContract`
  - `FeedbackDispatcherContract`
  - `FeedbackTemplateResolverContract`
  - `FeedbackCredentialResolverContract`
- Added runtime services:
  - `FeedbackChannelRegistry`
  - `FeedbackDispatcher`
  - `PassthroughFeedbackTemplateResolver`
  - `NullFeedbackCredentialResolver`
  - `NullFeedbackChannelDriver`
- Completed Phase 2 Feedback Event Mapping Baseline:
  - added `FeedbackEventData`
  - added `FeedbackEventMapperContract`
  - added `FeedbackEventMapperRegistryContract`
  - added `FeedbackEventMapperRegistry`
  - added `UnknownFeedbackEventMapperException`
  - added package config mapper extension seam
  - supports runtime mapper registration
  - supports class-string mapper resolution through the Laravel container
  - maps registered feedback events into feedback intents
  - fails closed for unmapped events before delivery dispatch
  - keeps mapping independent from delivery persistence, routes, actions, journal, and lifecycle truth

## Discoveries

- `/Users/rli/PhpstormProjects/packages/x-feedback` did not exist before Wave 3.
- The planning file `x-feedbacl_codex_instructions.md` contains a filename typo but is the active Codex instruction file.
- Phase 1 can be implemented without touching x-change, x-action, x-journal, or any provider package.
- Phase 2 can translate generic event facts into feedback intents without adding real delivery or host package dependencies.

## Risks

- Future integrations must not let x-feedback become workflow authority.
- Real delivery drivers must not bypass delivery tracking once persistence is introduced.
- Message payloads may contain sensitive action, beneficiary, claim, or provider context and will need redaction before operator exposure.
- The null driver is a safe baseline and test seam, not proof of real provider delivery.
- Feedback event mappers can accidentally become business-decision code if they start inferring lifecycle state instead of translating supplied event facts.
- Unknown event mappings fail closed, which is safe but requires host packages to register mappers explicitly.

## Architectural Decisions

- Use `spatie/laravel-data` for DTOs to stay consistent with x-action and x-journal.
- Use explicit delivery statuses instead of booleans.
- Bind a null channel driver by default for safe package tests.
- Keep Phase 1 non-persistent and provider-free.
- Do not add routes, controllers, models, queues, or host package integrations in Phase 1.
- Keep feedback event mapping separate from delivery dispatch.
- Treat `FeedbackEventData` as a fact supplied by upstream packages, not a lifecycle decision made by x-feedback.
- Bind `FeedbackEventMapperRegistryContract` as the package-consumer seam for event-to-intent mapping.

## Test Coverage Status

Current coverage:

- feedback intent construction
- message actions/artifacts preservation
- recipient/channel/context preservation
- explicit delivery status list
- dispatcher through registered channel drivers
- unknown channel fail-closed behavior
- core service-provider bindings
- package config default
- architecture safety boundaries
- green x-feedback package suite: `9 passed, 38 assertions`
- generic feedback event modeling
- registered event-to-intent mapping
- mapper class-string container resolution
- unknown event fail-closed behavior
- event mapping boundary safety
- green x-feedback package suite: `15 passed, 71 assertions`

## Next Recommended Phase

Phase 3 — Template Resolution Baseline.

Recommended scope:

- template data DTOs
- template registry/resolver
- locale/profile-aware resolution tests
- no real channel/provider delivery
- no persistence

## Open Questions

- Which host event should be the first live mapper: claim succeeded, claim failed, disbursement failed, or operator alert?
- Should durable delivery records belong directly in x-feedback Phase 3 or wait for x-journal receipt integration?
- Which real channel should be implemented first: email, SMS, webhook, or in-app?
